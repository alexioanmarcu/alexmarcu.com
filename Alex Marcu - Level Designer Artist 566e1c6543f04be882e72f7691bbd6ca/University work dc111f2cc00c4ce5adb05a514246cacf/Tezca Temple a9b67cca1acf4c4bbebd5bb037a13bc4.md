# Tezca Temple

About: Tezca Temple is a short point and click puzzle game made as part of a group project. I was responsible for some of the background art, the design of some puzzles and the layout of the temple.

I used Hammer to quickly block out a room layout for the puzzles to use as a guide for the background art.
