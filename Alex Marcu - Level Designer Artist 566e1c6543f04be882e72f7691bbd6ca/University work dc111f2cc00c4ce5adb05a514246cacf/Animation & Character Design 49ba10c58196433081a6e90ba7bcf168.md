# Animation & Character Design

About: For the 2D animation course at Saxion University, I had to design two characters , animate both of them and put them in a basic game with background art drawn by me. For the knight I made a walk cycle with  8 frames, an idle animation with 4 frames and a jumping pose. For the monster I made a walk cycle with 16 frames.
